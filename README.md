This study investigates the structure of the human gene–disease
network to reveal patterns of gene interactions and disease associations. We applied community detection to identify both large
hubs and small gene modules and performed enrichment analyses
to understand their biological relevance. Additionally, we explored
indirect genetic relationships to uncover connections between diseases across different biomedical categories. Our findings highlight
specialized gene communities, central hub genes and cross-disease
associations, offering insights into the organization and functional
relationships within the gene–disease network.
